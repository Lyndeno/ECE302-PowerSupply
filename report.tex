\section{Introduction}

\section{Design}
The purpose of this power supply is to take a 60Hz, 120Vrms signal, and convert it to a +-10V DC signal. The circuit is divided into
several stages for easier understanding. These stages include a transformer stage, rectifier stage, filter stage, and regulator stage. The combination 
of these stages allow us to convert a 120Vrms signal from a standard wall outlet, and convert it into two rails, one supplying roughly 10V and one supplying -10V. 
The supply is designed to have a minimal amount of ripple so the current going into the load does not flucuate.
